SAE for Traffic flow prediction.
==================

A GPU powered deep neural network consisting of multiple layers of sparse
autoencoders in which the outputs of each layer is wired to the inputs of the
successive layer. Was done as a part of mini project (”Traffic Flow Prediction using
Big Data -A Deep learning Approach”))
The SAE can currently be used on MNIST , to predict handwritten digits ( digit recognizer )
